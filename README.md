# Sudanese Möbius Strip 

Möbius strip is a manifold that is not orientable and its boundary is a closed curve.
This Python code generates an embedding of Möbius strip
in 3 dimensional space such that its boundary is exactly a circle.

If we consider the Möbius strip as a vector bundle over $S^1$,
the interactive plot shows how to
identify each section (that has a constant distance from $S^1$) on the 
Sudanese strip with a corresponding section on a usual embedding, the same
is done for fibers as well (By moving the slider in the bottom of the plot).

The file `sudanese.html` contains the generated plot and `code.py` contains the python
code that generates the plot.
